Weather System Utilizing GPU Managed Particles and a Depth Pre-Pass Based Collision Detection Algorithm


This project aims to create a weather particle system that supports proper collision detection
between falling snow and objects rendered in the scene. Utilizing C++ and OpenGL, various buffers
and shaders are used to manage the presented particle systems. Two distinct particle systems are
created with this purpose in mind, and the advantages and disadvantages of each are discussed.
